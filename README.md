# tolerance-for-deer
Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, linear modeling, and AIC model comparison using R.

A survey was administered to Ohio landowners and hunters to determine these stakeholders opinions on the local deer herds. Exploratory Factor Analysis and then Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used on the survey data to determine the latent variable "tolerance for deer". Then I used linear regression to determine factors that can explain tolerance for deer.
